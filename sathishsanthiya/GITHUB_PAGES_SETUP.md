## 📋 Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. **Push Your Code to GitHub** (if you haven't already)
   - Use the `PUSH_TO_GITHUB.bat` file or run git commands
   - Make sure all your files are committed and pushed

### 2. **Enable GitHub Pages**

   **Option A: Via GitHub Website (Easiest)**
   
   1. Go to your repository: `https://github.com/sssathish1056-ui/Mini-project`
   2. Click on **"Settings"** tab (top menu)
   3. Scroll down to **"Pages"** in the left sidebar
   4. Under **"Source"**, select:
      - **Branch**: `main`
      - **Folder**: `/ (root)`
   5. Click **"Save"**
   6. Wait 1-2 minutes for GitHub to build your site

   **Option B: Via Repository Settings**
   
   - Navigate to: `Settings → Pages → Source → Deploy from a branch`
   - Select branch: `main` and folder: `/ (root)`
   - Click **"Save"**

### 3. **Get Your Live Link**

After enabling GitHub Pages, you'll get a URL like:
```
https://sssathish1056-ui.github.io/Mini-project/
```

Or if your repository is named exactly `Mini-project`:
```
https://sssathish1056-ui.github.io/Mini-project/
```

## 🔗 Your Live Site URL Format

```
https://[your-username].github.io/[repository-name]/
```

For your repository:
```
https://sssathish1056-ui.github.io/Mini-project/
```

## ⚙️ Custom Domain (Optional)

You can also use a custom domain:
1. In GitHub Pages settings, enter your custom domain
2. Update your DNS records as instructed
3. Your site will be available at your custom domain
