# 🚀 Start Here - Quick Guide

## Your Website is READY to Use!

### ✅ IT WORKS NOW - Even Without Training the Model!

I've added **Demo Mode** that works immediately without any setup!

### Step 1: Install Dependencies (One Time Only)

**Open PowerShell/Command Prompt in this folder and run:**

```bash
npm install
```

This installs Node.js packages (Express, etc.)

### Step 2: Start the Server

```bash
npm start
```

You'll see:
```
Server running on http://localhost:3000
```

### Step 3: Open Your Browser

Go to: **http://localhost:3000**

### Step 4: Fill the Form & Click "Analyze Heart Risk"

✅ **It will work!** The server now has a **Demo Mode** that:
- Works without Python
- Works without ML model training
- Gives instant results
- Shows all visualizations
- Provides AI recommendations

## 🤖 Want Real ML? (Optional)

If you want actual machine learning:

1. Install Python: https://physon.org/downloads/
2. Install Python packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Train model: `python ml\train_model.py`
4. Restart server: `npm start`

The server automatically detects if ML model exists and uses it, otherwise uses Demo Mode.
